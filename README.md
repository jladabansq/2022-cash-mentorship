**Mentor**

I was matched with my mentor Brett Markowitz: [@bmarkowitz](https://my.sqprod.co/profile/bmarkowitz)

 <br/>
 
**Mentorship Goal**

My ultimate goal for this mentorship was to explore the frontend web development throughout the next two quarters. As for my mentor Brett, he aimed to improve his mentorship skills.

 <br/>

**Learning Path and Resources**

I decided to learn frontend web development through this LinkedIn learning path: [Become a Front-End Web Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-front-end-web-developer?u=2094516)

 <br/>
 
**Conclusion**

I finished taking all of the courses in the learning path, and earned the certificate for it. The end result of the site I built from scratch can be viewed here: [Jane's Portfolio](https://jladabansq.github.io/2022-cash-mentorship/)

**Disclaimer**

During the mentorship cycle, I mainly worked on my local machine and did not utilize this repository. After the cycle ended was the only time I pushed up my work here, so the timestamp on the files does not reflect the actual time I worked on them.
